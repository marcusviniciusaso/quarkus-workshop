It switched to Little CMS (LCMS) with JDK8.\n                        OpenJDK uses LCMS. If you continued to use KCMS by using the property ``sun.java2d.cmm=sun.java2d.cmm.kcms.KcmsServiceProvider``, remove this property and ensure in your tests that your application still works as expected.\n                    </message>\n                    <link href=\"https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2489791\" title=\"Knowledge base article OracleJDK vs. OpenJDK\"/>\n                    <tag>JDK-color-management</tag>\n                </hint>\n            </perform>\n        </rule>"}
