Instead, the thread should be notified to stop using a shared variable or `interrupt()`.\n                        The `java.lang.Thread.destroy()` method was never even implemented and just throws `NoSuchMethodError`.\n                    </message>\n                    <link href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/concurrency/threadPrimitiveDeprecation.html\" title=\"Java Thread Primitive Deprecation\"/>\n                </hint>\n            </perform>\n        </rule>"}
